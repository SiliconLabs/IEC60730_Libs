 * @details
 * For IEC 60730, a plausibility check must be performed to check that the
 * system clock is running at a frequency with an expected bounds.  This
 * check requires that the system clock frequency be compared against a second,
 * independent clock's frequency (test clock).
 *
 * @section system_clock_hardware_architecture Hardware Architecture
 * EFR32 family devices provide a high frequency internal oscillator as well
 * as a low frequency internal oscillator.  The devices also provide timers
 * modules that can be configured to use either oscillator as a clock
 * source.  These peripherals can be configured to vector code to interrupt
 * service routines when the counter incremented by the peripheral and clocked
 * by one of the clock sources meets certain criteria.
 *
 * For timers, the criteria is a counter overflow event. The frequency of
 * this overflow is defined by a reload value configured in firmware that hardware
 * automatically loads into the timer's counter upon overflow.
 *
 * Some timers offer a special mode where the timer's clock source is gated
 * by a falling edge of the low frequency oscillator.  In these cases, the
 * system clock can be used as the clock source, and the number of timer counter
 * ticks captured during the low frequency oscillator's logic low phase expresses
 * the relationship between the two clocks.
 *
 * The define SL_IEC60730_SYS_CLOCK_TEST_CLK_FREQ holds the ratio value between system clock timer interrupt period and
 * test clock timer interrupt period, this value is used to compare with the system clock counter. The ratio value is divided by slow
 * timer period (test clock timer interrupt period) and fast timer period (system clock timer interrupt period).
 *
 * The tolerance of test (OEM set value of the define, example: SL_IEC60730_SYS_CLOCK_TEST_TOLERANCE) is typical (+/-) 10%-49% of the SL_IEC60730_SYS_CLOCK_TEST_CLK_FREQ.
 *
 * @section system_clock_suggested_OEM_configuration Suggested OEM Configuration
 *  Not every EFR32 device offers the same types of timers and clock sources.  For this
 * reason, the optimal resource usage on each device family varies.  The following
 * chart offers a suggested configuration for each EFR32 family.
 * Firmware examples configure system and test timers as in \link system_clock_test_suggested_oem_configuration_chart Table 1\endlink

 * @section system_clock_failure_risks Failure Risks
 * The library's system clock plausibility test will force entry into
 * safe state if the frequency relationship between the system clock and
 * the test clock exceeds upper and lower bounds.
 *
 * The library examines the relationship between the two clocks using calls
 * that the OEM must place in OEM-defined timer interrupt service routines.
 * Code examples for each EFR32 device provide drop-in firmware solutions for
 * OEMs for timer initialization and ISR source code.  OEMs must ensure that
 * timer ISRs are able to be serviced promptly during operation.
 *
 * Additionally, the OEM is responsible for leaving the system clock at
 * a constant and defined operating frequency throughout all OEM firmware.
 *
 * Finally, the OEM is responsible for setting sl_iec60730_timer_test_control to SL_IEC60730_TIMER_TEST_DISABLE
 * within safety-critical code by calling function sl_iec60730_sys_clock_test_disable. This value is only used in cases
 * where the system is executing non-safety-critical code, where the BIST routine is also not being called.
 * When returning to normal operation, clear all interrupt counters in
 * iec60730_IRQExecCount, reset the timer clock tick and system clock tick timers,
 * and set sl_iec60730_timer_test_control to SL_IEC60730_TIMER_TEST_ENABLE.
